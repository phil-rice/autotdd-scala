So we want to transform things to other things.

Examples

XML to Domain
JSon to Domain
Json to Json
Domain to Domain


So I need to deal with tree structures.

Start at the top and iterate down. As I go I have a side effect: building something up


recursive descent parser might be a simple approach, although the Parser Monad is actually awesome.


library : [
   book : {name : 'Harry Potter: Philospher's stone',
           price : 4.50
           currency: 'GBP'}
]

var jsonToLibrary = ..

val book1Json

constraint ('library'
   



Sometimes the structure is constrained.


How do I make this clear...
I have a context which is the whole tree so far
I have the bit which is me, and I need to specify where that is 






Use cases
I want to iterate through some Json data, and import each item as a domain object
I want to  iterate through Json, cleanse (eliminate duff items, remove duplicates for some value of duplicate, and add fields) 

Questions
* Do we want to do transformation or mirrors
** For example data binding: as one changes, we want consequential changes to ripple through. This is important for fat clients
For new we will do 'I shot'
